🔐 SecureCrypt Tool
A simple yet powerful encryption and decryption tool written in C.
This project demonstrates basic cryptography concepts using classic encryption algorithms and file handling techniques.

🚀 Features

- 🔑 Text Encryption
- 🔓 Text Decryption
- 📂 File-based encryption support
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight
- 🧠 Beginner-friendly implementation

🛠️ Technologies Used

- C Programming Language
- Standard C Libraries
- File Handling
- String Manipulation

📌 How It Works

This tool takes an input file or text, applies an encryption algorithm, and generates an encrypted output file.
To decrypt, it reverses the process using the same key.

 ▶️ How to Run

1. Compile the program:

```bash
gcc main.c -o securecrypt
